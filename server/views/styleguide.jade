                    | for performance and will run our site through the google site analyzer on a regular basis and follow 
                    | the tools recommendations.  <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">

                            | stuff data returned from an http request.  You will also notice that we pass the title of the page
                            | to view bag, so that we could put the page title in the layout template and not have to worry

                            | Express handles changes to the .styl files and compiles new .css files.  We are using one file called
