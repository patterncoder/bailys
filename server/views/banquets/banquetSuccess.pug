        | for your banquet dollars.
    p Any conceivable function that requires tasty food, friendly service and an appropriate

        | casual atmosphere. Upstairs, Bailyâ€™s serves California/Continental cuisine in an elegant setting.
        | Each restaurant features indoor and outdoor seating with private rooms available. A courtyard
        | on the first level features a large space complete with a stage and a bar for outdoor receptions.
    p Types of events that we have served include weddings, rehearsal dinners, holiday parties,
        | birthday and anniversary celebrations, business meetings and presentations, class reunions,
        | civic functions, memorial services and more.
    p This section of our website will introduce you to the various dining rooms, our numerous
        | menus, and the process of booking an event. If you have any questions please do not hesitate
        | to call our Events Manager at extension 100. We hope our efforts to document this information
        | will entice you to "break bread" with us.

    p Sincerely,
